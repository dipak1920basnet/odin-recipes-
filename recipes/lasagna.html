          <li>1.5 to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
          <li>3 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
          <li>3 celery stalks, sliced</li>
          <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>1 cup frozen peas (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <li>For the Dumplings:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Instructions:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Set your Instant Pot to the sauté mode and add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onions, carrots, and celery. Sauté for about 3-5 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
          <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
          <li>Add the chicken pieces and brown them slightly on all sides. This should take about 3-5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Pour in the chicken broth and add the dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt, and pepper. Give everything a good stir.</li>
          <li>Close the Instant Pot lid and set it to "Pressure Cook" on high for 10 minutes. Make sure the steam release valve is set to "Sealing."</li>
          <li>While the chicken stew is cooking, prepare the dumpling dough. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the melted butter and milk, and stir until a sticky dough forms.</li>
          <li>Once the pressure cooking cycle is complete, perform a quick release by turning the steam release valve to "Venting."</li>
          <li>Open the Instant Pot, and if you'd like, add the frozen peas. Stir them into the hot stew until they thaw.</li>
          <li>Spoon small portions of the dumpling dough and drop them into the hot chicken stew, making sure they're evenly distributed.</li>
          <li>Close the Instant Pot lid again and set it to "Pressure Cook" on high for an additional 5 minutes. Again, make sure the steam release valve is set to "Sealing."</li>
          <li>After the second pressure cooking cycle, perform another quick release.</li>
          <li>Carefully open the Instant Pot lid and give the chicken and dumplings a gentle stir.</li>
          <li>Serve the chicken and dumplings hot in bowls, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
