        Chicken pot pie is a classic comfort dish filled with tender chicken, vegetables, and a creamy sauce, all enclosed in a flaky pastry crust. Here's an HTML representation of the ingredients and instructions for making chicken pot pie:
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
  <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
  <li>1 cup diced celery</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
  <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
  <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
  <li>1 cup frozen corn kernels</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>2 refrigerated pie crusts or homemade pie dough</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
  <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the diced chicken and cook until it's no longer pink. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
  <li>In the same skillet, add the diced onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables until they become tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat them evenly. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw taste of the flour.</li>
  <li>Gradually add the chicken broth and whole milk, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. This should take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
  <li>Stir in the cooked chicken, frozen peas, frozen corn, dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the mixture to heat through.</li>
  <li>Roll out one pie crust and place it in the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish or a similarly-sized baking dish.</li>
  <li>Pour the chicken and vegetable mixture into the pie crust-lined dish.</li>
  <li>Roll out the second pie crust and place it on top of the filling. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal the pie.</li>
  <li>Use a knife to create a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
  <li>Allow the chicken pot pie to cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
